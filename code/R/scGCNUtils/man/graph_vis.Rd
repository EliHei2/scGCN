\title{graph visualization and community detection}
\usage{
graph_vis(graph, directed = F, community = T, betweenness = T, plot = F, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{graph}{An arbitrary graph object in R.}

\item{directed}{Set it TRUE when the graph is directed. (default = FALSE)}

\item{community}{A logical value to show if the node communities should be detected and colored in the returned graph. (default = TRUE)}

\item{betweenness}{A logical value to show if the node betweenness measurements should be computed and returned from the function. (default = TRUE)}

\item{plot}{A logical value to show if the graph should be plotted. (default = FALSE)}

\item{...}{Any additional arguments described below.}
}
\value{
If plot = TRUE it plots the non-interactive graph (If plot.community = TRUE plots communities too) also returns a list contains:
\item{graph}{an igraph object.}
\item{betweenness}{betweenness measurements of each node.}
\item{network}{a visNetwork plot of the graph.}
\item{communities}{a named vector indicating the community of each node.}
}
\description{
Converts the graph to an igraph object, finds communities and plots it using qgraph package.
}
\section{Additional arguments}{

\describe{
\item{groups}{A list that indicates which community each node is. The automatic community detection will be ignored when it is set.}
\item{plot.community}{Logical indicating if communities should be plotted. Defaults to FALSE.}
\item{filename}{Name of the plot file without extension. (qgraph function argument)}
\item{filetype}{A character indicates the file type to save the plots in. (qgraph function argument)}
\item{community.list}{A list indicates which communities should be plotted. When is not set, will plot all the communities.}
}
